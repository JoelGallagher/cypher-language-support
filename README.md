# cypher-lsp

LSP for Neo4j's Cypher query language

![](./auto-completion.gif)

## Requirements

- Having [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) VSCode extension installed.

## Try out only the parser

To generate the parser only:

```
npm run gen-parser
```

Run a query with

```
antlr4-parse server/src/antlr/Cypher.g4 oC_Cypher -gui
[Write query][Enter]
[Ctrl-D]
```

## Testing it out

To start a database:

```
docker run --restart always --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/pass12345 --env NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes neo4j:5.3.0-enterprise
```

Run a `CREATE (n:Person); CREATE (n:Dog)` in the database to get some labels.

To run the extension in development mode in VSCode:

```
npm run compile
```

Go to `Run & Debug` tab and `Launch Cypher Language Client`.

Credentials are hardcoded to `neo4/pass12345` in the server.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting: incomplete but it works well.
- Auto completion: works moderately well. Has a proof of concept on how to complete elements coming from the database (e.g. labels).
- Multi-query: works well but it should be improved.
- Error highlighting: still to improve, inaccurate positions and errors. No semantic errors.

## Tree-sitter

A very basic skeleton for a Cypher grammar has been added for testing purposes to [tree-sitter-cypher](./tree-sitter-cypher/).

The latest version, namely 0.20.1, of [nodeâ€“tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter) used there required node 16, which we installed using `n install 16.19.0`, and using [tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) version 0.20.6 (may require to be installed globally with `npm install --global tree-sitter-cli).

To generate the parser, go to [tree-sitter-cypher](./tree-sitter-cypher/) and do:

```
tree-sitter generate
```

To test the parser, do:

```
tree-sitter parse example.cypher
```
