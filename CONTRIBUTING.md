## Building the project

Pre-requisites:

- Node.js LTS (18.x)
- [antlr4-tools](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-tools) easiest to install with `pip install antlr4-tools` (python3 required)

In the root folder of the project run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

From here you can start the `react-codemirror-playground` with:

`npm run dev:codemirror`

To run the VSCode extension, see the `vscode-extension` [readme.md](./packages/vscode-extension/).

// todo check what's broken with node 21
// todo standardize npm commands
